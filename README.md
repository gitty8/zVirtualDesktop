__Installation__  
This program uses `IsolatedStorage` for the settings file so in order for each new version to read the same settings file it is important that the program be unzipped and run from the same location everytime.

It's preferable to run directly from the `Startup` folder

You can get to the `Startup` folder by typing `Startup` into the address bar of any Windows Explorer window. Simply copy the file into that folder.

__Features:__

__Hotkeys:__

These are the default hotkeys. You can configure these any way you'd like.

__Navigate Desktops:__  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Numpad</kbd>  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>NumberKeys</kbd>  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>LEFT</kbd> or <kbd>RIGHT</kbd> - this is Windows Default and can be overridden to allow "Round Robin"   

__Move Windows:__  
The foreground window will be the window which moves  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>Numpad</kbd>  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>NumberKeys</kbd>  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>LEFT</kbd> or <kbd>RIGHT</kbd>

__Move Window & Follow:__  
The foreground window will be the window which moves  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>Numpad</kbd>  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>NumberKeys</kbd>  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>LEFT</kbd> or <kbd>RIGHT</kbd>

__Pin/Unpin Windows:__  
The foreground window will be the window which is pinned  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd>

__Pin/Unpin Applications:__  
The foreground window will be the window which is pinned  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>

__What is the difference between pin app and pin window?__  
An easy way to imagine this is if you use `pin window` on a chrome browser window, 
only that window will be visible on all desktops. Any other chrome windows would 
stay on a single desktop. If you were to `pin application` on a chrome window then 
all chrome windows would show up on all desktops. This includes new chrome windows.

__System Tray Icon:__  
-Choose from several sets of icons  
-The icons indicate which desktop you are viewing  
-`Left-Click` the system tray icon to bring up the default Task View overlay.  
-`Double-Left-Click` the system tray icon to show the settings form.  
-`Right-Click` the system tray icon to bring up the main menu. You can donate to me in this menu since you love this app :)

Make your own icons and attach them to an issue then I will add them to the program.  
[How to submit icon files](https://github.com/mzomparelli/zVirtualDesktop/issues/23)

Download the current icons and alter ones you like. I ask that you come up with a name for your icon theme.

__Move All Windows__  
I added a really handy feature which you can also create a hotkey for.
This feature lets you move all open windows across all desktops to the currently active desktop.
